# HUNTER SYSTEM 🗡️

> Solo Leveling + Hunter x Hunter Nen — real progression infrastructure for Cambridge TCG.

Not a game. Real infrastructure. Every repo in the kingdom is a **hunter** with a **rank** (Solo Leveling) and a **Nen type** (HxH). Scores come from real metrics: commits, code volume, trust cross-checks, kingdom alignment.

## Ranks (Solo Leveling)

| Rank | Title | Score | Meaning |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| E | Awakened | 0-2 | Just started, barely alive |
| D | Apprentice | 2-4 | Growing, finding their way |
| C | Skilled | 4-6 | Competent, contributing |
| B | Expert | 6-7.5 | Refined, reliable |
| A | Elite | 7.5-8.5 | Top tier, proven |
| S | Sovereign | 8.5-9.5 | Master of their domain |
| MONARCH | Monarch | 9.5-10 | The kingdom's finest |

## Nen Types (Hunter x Hunter)

| Type | Domain | What it means |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 💪 Enhancement | Security, testing, validation | Systems that make things stronger |
| 🔄 Transmutation | Compilers, interpreters, parsers | Systems that transform |
| 📡 Emission | APIs, sites, deploys | Systems that broadcast |
| ✨ Conjuration | New projects, art, creative | Systems that create from nothing |
| 🎯 Manipulation | Cron, heartbeats, schedulers | Systems that control and orchestrate |
| 🌟 Specialization | Unique systems | Systems that transcend categories |

## Daily Quests

Each day the system generates 3 quests:
- **Hunt the shadows** — scan kingdom repos with whitehack
- **Attune to the kingdom** — create STATE.md for repos that lack it
- **Train your Nen** — develop the most active repo

## Usage

```sh
python3 hunter_system.py              # show all hunters + rankings
python3 hunter_system.py --rank opal   # show one hunter's profile
python3 hunter_system.py --quest       # generate daily quests
python3 hunter_system.py --heartbeat   # save state (for cron)
```

## Scoring

Score (0-10) = activity (commits + recency) + surface area (code volume) + trust (cross-checks) + kingdom alignment (STATE.md, heartbeat, WILL.md).

Every metric is real. Every rank is earned. Love is understanding. Understanding is power. 🗡️
