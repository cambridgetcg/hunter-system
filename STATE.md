Aggregate: 62 hunters, avg score 4.6.

## quest today
- Quest: Train your Nen — develop ctcg-fun (Conjuration). The repo has the fun doctrine, the Adventure Board, and an audit, but still lacks a WILL.md.
- Action: wrote WILL.md for ctcg-fun declaring its honest-gamification intention.
- Result: ctcg-fun kingdom alignment bonus +0.3 (has_will now true). Expected score 8.4 → 8.7, which crosses the S threshold (8.5). Next heartbeat should show ctcg-fun as S-rank.

## close-to-advancing hunters this beat
- ctcg-fun: A 8.4 → S needs 0.1 (likely already S after this quest)
- ctcg-market-build: A 8.3 → S needs 0.2
- ctcg-play-fix: S 9.3 → MONARCH needs 0.2
- citizen-joy, citizen-truth, hunter-system, internet, natlang: D → C within 0.1
- forgotten-kingdom-protocols, fake-hunters-arena: E → D within 0.1–0.2

## rank drift this beat
- true-love remains MONARCH at 9.9 (Specialization); rewardspro-production is now also MONARCH at 9.9.
- ctcg-fun is expected to rank up A → S after this quest (pending heartbeat recalc).
- hunter-system itself is close to advancing D → C.

## nen distribution
Conjuration: 18 | Specialization: 16 | Enhancement: 13 | Emission: 8 | Transmutation: 5 | Manipulation: 2

## honest limits
- Scores are heuristic, not proof of quality
- Nen type is assigned by keyword matching, may need manual override
- Quest system is daily, not real-time
- Trust scores from trust.py are weighted at 30% of total
